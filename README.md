##  About <a name = "about"></a>

This project is a proposal sublitted in the scope of an Innoventive Challenge [New Smart City Solutions Enabled by Open Data](https://openinnovability.enel.com/projects/New-smart-city-solutions-enabled-by-open-data)
Our targeted users are: 
1.	Chief Operating Officer and/or operations of the city’s public lighting department
2.	Analysts working in the Urban Planning department
3.	Tourist Office officers (City DMOs)

The solution prototyped in the scope of this project is called DINA (Data-driven Implicit Needs Analyzer) and is made of 2 main components:

1.	DINA Open Data ingestion module
It aims at becoming a transversal component, supported by an extensible framework, which gathers, cleans, enriches and normalizes Open Data (coming from Public Administrations or not) in order to provide Smart City analytics solutions with 3 indexes representing the needs of people living in or visiting the city: 
•	Security Needs
•	Lighting Needs
•	Connectivity Needs
These indexes will be delivered per geographical location (square of 20m x 20m) and per month.

Note: our vision is obviously to increase granularity (lower the size of the geographical areas, provide data per day or even per hour) when Public Administration Open Data will permit and this is why Enel X has a key role to play to influence City’s Open Data roadmaps.

2.	DINA “Needs Indexes” Visualization tool
The solution includes a data visualization module so that users could act according to the insights generated by the first module: maps/heatmap (with the possibility to browse per time period - in our case: month- and to filter by type of index). 
Note: In the scope of this challenge, the visualization solution will be delivered as a standalone User Interface, but the vision is to integrate it in City Analytics and Control Room directly, to complement existing visualization tools (e.g. adding a new layer to existing maps)


##  Getting Started <a name = "getting_started"></a>

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See [deployment](#deployment) for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

What things you need to install the software and how to install them.

```
Give examples
```

### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development env running.

Say what the step will be

```
Give the example
```

And repeat

```
until finished
```

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo.
