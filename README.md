##  About <a name = "about"></a>

This project is a proposal sublitted in the scope of an Innoventive Challenge [New Smart City Solutions Enabled by Open Data](https://openinnovability.enel.com/projects/New-smart-city-solutions-enabled-by-open-data)
Our targeted users are: 
1.	Chief Operating Officer and/or operations of the city’s public lighting department
2.	Analysts working in the Urban Planning department
3.	Tourist Office officers (City DMOs)

The solution prototyped in the scope of this project is called DINA (Data-driven Implicit Needs Analyzer) and is made of 2 main components:

1.	DINA Open Data ingestion module
It aims at becoming a transversal component, supported by an extensible framework, which gathers, cleans, enriches and normalizes Open Data (coming from Public Administrations or not) in order to provide Smart City analytics solutions with 3 indexes representing the needs of people living in or visiting the city: 
•	Security Needs
•	Lighting Needs
•	Connectivity Needs
These indexes will be delivered per geographical location (square of 20m x 20m) and per month.

Note: our vision is obviously to increase granularity (lower the size of the geographical areas, provide data per day or even per hour) when Public Administration Open Data will permit and this is why Enel X has a key role to play to influence City’s Open Data roadmaps.

2.	DINA “Needs Indexes” Visualization tool
The solution includes a data visualization module so that users could act according to the insights generated by the first module: maps/heatmap (with the possibility to browse per time period - in our case: month- and to filter by type of index). 
Note: In the scope of this challenge, the visualization solution will be delivered as a standalone User Interface, but the vision is to integrate it in City Analytics and Control Room directly, to complement existing visualization tools (e.g. adding a new layer to existing maps)


##  Getting Started <a name = "getting_started"></a>

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See [deployment](#deployment) for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

Things you need to install the software and how to install them.

#### Here API Key to benefit from Here! Rest APIs
1. Get an Here! Freemium Account (location APIs) [here](https://developer.here.com/sign-up?create=Freemium-Basic&keepState=true&step=account)
2. Create an app and generate an API key
3. Store the API key in an environment variable called `here_api_key` (for Windows 10, follow this [procedure](https://www.onmsft.com/how-to/how-to-set-an-environment-variable-in-windows-10))


### Installing Python and pip


You need to install:
1. a recent version of Python (see [for instance this package for Windows](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-385/))
2. the pip tool in order to install Python packages (see [installation guide](https://www.liquidweb.com/kb/install-pip-windows/))

Once pip is installed, download the requested python packages (folium for maps display, pandas for csv files processing) by opening a command line and typing

`$ pip install folium`
`$ pip install pandas`


##  Usage <a name="usage"></a>

## Run the DINA Open Data Ingestion module
Thierry to complete

## Generate and display the DINA Heat Maps (Lighting Needs Index, Security Needs Index, Connectivity Needs Index)

Open a command line and go to the folder where DINA has been downloaded and commands:
`python` 
`display_maps`


It will generate 3 html files containing the maps in the sub-folder ./map/ and try to open them with a web browser:
* [DINA_Lighting_Needs_Index.html](./map/DINA_Lighting_Needs_Index.html)
* [DINA_Security_Needs_Index.html](./map/DINA_Security_Needs_Index.html)
* [DINA_Connectivity_Needs_Index.html](./map/DINA_Connectivity_Needs_Index.html)
